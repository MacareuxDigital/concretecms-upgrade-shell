# concrete5 Core Upgrade Shell:

This is simple shell script to upgrade your concrete5 site overriding the core "concrete" directory.
This is suitable for someone who don't want to pile up concrete5 versions in "update" directory.

Since you're using GitHub, I assume you know what you're doing. This is the script that runs on your server.

This upgrade script supports Ver 8.0.0 and above fully, and 5.7.x partially
